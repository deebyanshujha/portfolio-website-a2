          <h2>Few lines about me</h2>
          <p class="para1">
            I am a dedicated Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at
            VIT Vellore, currently pursuing my B.Tech with a specialization in
            Internet of Things. I have maintained a CGPA of 9.07 up to the 3rd
            semester, which reflects my consistent academic performance and
            strong understanding of core computer science subjects. Alongside my
            studies, I have solved over 500 problem-solving questions, helping
            me develop solid analytical thinking, algorithmic skills, and a
            structured approach to tackling complex problems.
          </p>
          <p class="para1">
            I have a growing interest in backend development and enjoy learning
            how scalable systems, databases, and server-side logic work together
            to build efficient applications. I am actively working on
            strengthening my foundation in programming, data structures, and
            system design concepts. I believe in continuous learning and
            self-improvement and regularly explore new technologies to enhance
            my technical skill set. Through academic projects and personal
            practice, I aim to apply my knowledge to real-world problems and
            grow into a competent and responsible software engineer.

              <p style="color: white">
                In my free time, I enjoy engaging in activities that help me
                relax and improve my skills outside academics. One of my primary
                hobbies is playing games, which helps me develop strategic
                thinking and problem-solving skills.

              <br />
              <p style="color: white">
                I also have a keen interest in clicking photos, which allows me
                to express creativity and capture moments from different
                perspectives. Photography helps me improve my observation skills
                and attention to detail, as it requires focus on lighting,
                angles, and composition. It encourages me to see beauty in
                everyday scenes and enhances my creative thinking. This hobby
                also complements my interest in design and visual presentation.

                Another hobby of mine is watching web series, which helps me
                relax while also exposing me to diverse stories, cultures, and
                ideas. It enhances my ability to understand different
                perspectives and improves my attention to detail through complex
                narratives and character development. Watching web series also
                keeps me engaged with modern storytelling and creative content,
                allowing me to unwind while gaining inspiration.
