          <h2>ABOUT THE WEBSITE</h2>
          <p id="para1">
            This website is a personal portfolio created using HTML and CSS to
            showcase my skills, projects, and personal details in a structured
            and professional manner. A portfolio acts as proof of an
            individual’s abilities and provides a unique way to present one’s
            work while giving others an overview of their background and
            interests. This website serves as a platform to introduce myself,
            highlight my technical skills, and demonstrate my understanding of
            front-end web development. The portfolio consists of multiple
            sections, including Introduction, About Me, Services, Portfolio, and
            Contact Details. The introduction section provides a brief overview
            of who I am, while the about section explains my academic background
            and interests. The services section outlines the skills and
            solutions I can offer, and the portfolio section displays my
            projects and work samples. Finally, the contact section allows
            visitors to easily reach out to me. Overall, this website is
            designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly, reflecting both
            my technical knowledge and creativity.
